# cargo-sweb
Simple and convenient cargo subcommand to develop web applications

## Rationale

Why another web builder helper? Aren't there already tools for that? Yes, there are at least [cargo-web](https://github.com/koute/cargo-web) which appears to be dead with the maintainer MIA, and [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) which is too npm-oriented in my opinion.
I just want a _simple_ tool for conveniently building Rust-based web applications without any reliance on other ecosystems.
